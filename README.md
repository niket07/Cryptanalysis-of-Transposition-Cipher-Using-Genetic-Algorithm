# Cryptanalysis-of-Transposition-Cipher-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
This project involves the cryptanalysis of Transposition Cipher i.e. to obtain the key that would help to decrypt the cipher text. Genetic Algorithm and gram statistics are used to find the closest key. The files description is as:
1. Encryption.c : Takes plain text from a file and converts it into the corresponding cipher text using Transposition cipher. This cipher text is also then stored on a file.
2. Decipher.c : Cipher text is supplied as input and the output produced is corresponding plain text. 
3. GramStatistics.c : Fitrness function is generated using this code. It uses quad, tri and bi gram analysis of plain text.
